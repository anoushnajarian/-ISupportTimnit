This chat is how I found out I was resignated. From my direct report in shock who was trying to reach me. I then informed my manager Samy after she informed me. She had just joined our team in May. 
@JeffDean
 there are no words left to describe this & your subsequent gasligthing
1. https://twitter.com/timnitGebru/status/1350218858452443143?s=20 This is not creepy at all.
1. https://twitter.com/timnitGebru/status/1350111062193008643?s=20 I got contacted by someone at Google a while ago saying they’re doing an investigation and can I talk to them. As if  I don’t know these *investigations* are ass covering exercises that come to the conclusion that there was no wrong doing by powerful people at the company.

This type of reporting is possible because a certain Black Woman took a stand and would not allow her tone to be policed by corporate PR. #ISupportTimnit #BiasInAI

When granted access you must sometimes use that opportunity to stand in solidarity for someone else who was wronged by the same people. Timnit Gebru didn't deserve this treatment by Google and @GoogleForEdu doesn't deserve my help any longer as well. #ISupportTimnit

Serious question: Does "Looking Back at 2020" include acknowledgement of your clear mistreatment of 
@timnitGebru
, or are you just "Looking Forward" to more of the same "white guys in tech" BS for 2021?

I'm glad to see, in the QTs and replies, that this strategy of just pretending they didn't fire 
@timnitGebru
 isn't going to work, at least not here on Twitter. Huge credit to 
@timnitGebru
 herself and her team at Google (esp. 
@alexhanna
 and others) for speaking out.

"To make this easier for others to adopt for their own machine learning models, we also introduced the Model Card Toolkit for easier model transparency reporting." 
Yes, 
@timnitGebru
 did do excellent work before you fired her.

People in tech: if you're hearing from Google recruiters, now is as good a time as any to explain to them why Google's treatment of former employees like 
@timnitGebru, @computerfemme, and @lizthegrey is driving away talent.

@BryanDMartin_ https://twitter.com/BryanDMartin_/status/1334635603627966464?s=20 What sway do I have over a company like Google? Essentially none. But they have been recruiting me, and I had an interview scheduled in a week.  I won't contribute to a company that treats its employees the way Google treated @timnitGebru

Just wanted to say that I was stunned by what just happened to Timnit Gebru, who was in my team until a few days ago (I'm sure you've all read what happened already). I have always been and will remain a strong supporter of her scientific work to make sure that AI becomes a positive force for the minoritized, as well as her generosity and tireless actions to lift the voices of the silenced ones. She taught me a lot and still is. I stand by you, Timnit. I also stand by the rest of my team who, like me, was stunned and is trying to make sense of all this. In particular the Ethical AI team, but also the broader Brain Research team.
