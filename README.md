This chat is how I found out I was resignated. From my direct report in shock who was trying to reach me. I then informed my manager Samy after she informed me. She had just joined our team in May. 
@JeffDean
 there are no words left to describe this & your subsequent gasligthing

This type of reporting is possible because a certain Black Woman took a stand and would not allow her tone to be policed by corporate PR. #ISupportTimnit #BiasInAI

When granted access you must sometimes use that opportunity to stand in solidarity for someone else who was wronged by the same people. Timnit Gebru didn't deserve this treatment by Google and @GoogleForEdu doesn't deserve my help any longer as well. #ISupportTimnit

People in tech: if you're hearing from Google recruiters, now is as good a time as any to explain to them why Google's treatment of former employees like 
@timnitGebru, @computerfemme, and @lizthegrey is driving away talent.
